There is only one R script associated with this project - "run_analysis.R"  The instructor's instructions call for 5 steps and
2 data files.  All steps are included in the R code in the run_analysis file.  The two files are also output.  

The "run_analysis.R" file inputs 6 files from the project directories: X-train, X-test, y_train, y_test, subject_train and subject_test.

Explanations of the R code that do the transformations of the data from raw form to a tidy data set are included in the "codebook.Rmd" file.
